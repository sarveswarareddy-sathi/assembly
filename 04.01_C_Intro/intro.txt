Compiler - GCC, Visual Studio & mingw
Compiler - translates computer code written in one programming language into another machine readable executable code.

Compiler Process - 
1. Take high-level programs
2. Generate an intermediate representation
3. Apply optimizations
4. Generate an output program 

Output - depends on target architecture - windows x86, OS X x86, android arm & ios arm

Output file format - file readable by OS
--> Binary file format - ELF by linux, COEF/PE by windows & MACH-O by OS x86

Tools - PEView on windows, objdump by linux and some disassembler - IDA Pro, Binary ninja & ghidra

Hex editors - allows to view, edit and save using hexadecimal representation

Reading Binary Formats - within python can do too
